Project Description
Converting long passage to summary to traverse through the passage in smallest possible time while maintaining all the vital detail in the passage.

Dataset Used
Here we have used amazon fast food review dataset since the size of passage is considerably small for our machine learning model to easily process and fit to dataset.

Evaluation
For evaluation of our project we are using ROGUE evaluation
